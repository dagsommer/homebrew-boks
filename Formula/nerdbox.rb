  # Bump this whenever packaging/nerdbox/patches/ changes, and ONLY then.
  #
  # A formula's version comes from its url, and that is a nerdbox tag this project pins
  # deliberately. Adding or changing a patch therefore changes what the formula BUILDS while
  # leaving what it CLAIMS TO BE identical — so `brew upgrade` sees nothing outdated, rebuilds
  # nothing, and the shim on disk stays the one from before the patch. The user gets a new
  # boks, an unchanged shim, and a bug that was supposed to be fixed.
  #
  # `revision` is Homebrew's answer to exactly that: it is part of the version for comparison
  # (0.2.3_1) and nothing else, so bumping it forces the rebuild without pretending the
  # upstream tag moved.
  #
  # 1: 0002 raised the layer count at which the shim packs layers into one disk.
  # 2: 0003 reports idmap mount support from Info, so Boks can idmap workspace shares.

  # This formula is pinned to a nerdbox tag on purpose, and the pin is a Boks decision rather
  # than a packaging convenience: v0.2.3 is the release containing cd2c23f, the commit
  # docs/verification.md records the VM boundary being verified against. Moving it means the
  # shim under Boks is no longer the shim the evidence was collected with, so bump it
  # deliberately and re-run the procedure in that document.

    # no_grpc tag is upstream's; the shim links no C and dlopens libkrun at runtime through

  end

  # The signature is applied here, not in `install`, and the ordering is the whole reason.
  #
  # libkrun cannot use Hypervisor.framework unless the process carries the
  # `com.apple.security.hypervisor` entitlement. Without it a sandbox does not fail to
  # start — it starts and then dies inside libkrun with `krun_start_enter failed: -22`,
  # which names neither code signing nor the entitlement. `boks doctor` has a check for
  # exactly this (`runtime entitlement`) because the error names nothing.
  #
  # Homebrew re-signs Mach-O files whose load commands it has had to patch, in
  # `fix_dynamic_linkage`. On Intel it re-signs with
  # `--preserve-metadata=entitlements,requirements,flags,runtime`; on Apple silicon it uses
  # ruby-macho's `MachO.codesign!`, which writes a plain ad-hoc signature and carries no
  # entitlements across. A shim signed during `install` — or baked into a bottle — could
  # therefore arrive unsigned-in-the-way-that-matters on precisely the architecture this
  # formula is restricted to. `fix_dynamic_linkage` runs before `post_install`
  # (FormulaInstaller#finish), so signing here is applied last and survives, whether the keg
  # was built from source or poured from a bottle.

           bin/"containerd-shim-nerdbox-v1"
  end

  # The honest part. This formula installs the shim; it cannot install the guest.
  #
  # nerdbox boots a Linux kernel and an EROFS root filesystem that it builds with
  # `docker buildx bake` — the kernel from a kernel.org tarball, the rootfs with mkfs.erofs
  # over a Go init and a downloaded crun. Homebrew builds have no Docker and no Linux
  # cross-toolchain, so neither can be produced here. `boks` fetches them from a Boks release
  # instead, which is why installing `boks` gives you a working stack and installing this
  # formula alone does not.
  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      This formula installed the shim and signed it with com.apple.security.hypervisor.
      It did NOT install the guest kernel or root filesystem, which nerdbox builds with
      Docker and publishes nowhere. Until those two files exist, a sandbox fails at boot
      with:

        nerdbox-kernel not found in PATH or LIBKRUN_PATH

      `boks doctor` reports this as `guest image`: fail.

      `brew install boks` installs them, from a Boks release. To place them by hand instead,
      put both in #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/lib — which is on the shim's own search path on Apple
      silicon — or in any directory on containerd's PATH or on LIBKRUN_PATH:

        https://github.com/dagsommer/boks/releases

      containerd resolves this shim through its own PATH, which is the daemon's and not
      your shell's. If containerd cannot find #{opt_bin}, start it with that directory on
      PATH — or let `boks daemon start` do it.
    EOS
  end

  test do
    # The shim is a containerd plugin: it speaks ttrpc on a socket handed to it by containerd
    # and has no meaningful standalone invocation. What can be asserted without a hypervisor
    # is that it is present, executable, and — the thing that actually breaks — carries the
    # entitlement.

Subject: [PATCH] fix(vminitd): resolve Process.User.Username against the guest
 rootfs

An OCI image may name its user rather than number it -- `USER node` rather
than `USER 1000`. Resolving that name means reading /etc/passwd out of the
image's root filesystem, and the runtime spec has a field for handing the
unresolved name to whoever can do that: Process.User.Username.

Nothing reads it. crun consults `user->uid`, `user->gid`, `user->umask` and
`user->additional_gids` and nothing else -- every read of that struct in
src/libcrun/linux.c and src/libcrun/container.c is one of those four. And
`username` *is* in the OCI config schema (runtime-spec
schema/config-schema.json, the process.user object), so libocispec parses it
without complaint and crun then ignores the result.

That combination is the dangerous one. An unknown field would be rejected and
the container would fail to start; a known-but-ignored field fails silently.
`uid` keeps its zero value, so a container that asked to drop to `node` runs
as root without anything saying so.

nerdbox reaches this state on any host that cannot mount the image. containerd's
oci.WithUser resolves the name host-side by mounting the image's snapshot, which
needs CAP_SYS_ADMIN and is impossible on a macOS or Windows host holding a Linux
guest filesystem. containerd already knows this and has an explicit escape hatch:

    if (s.Windows != nil && s.Linux != nil) || runtime.GOOS == "darwin" {
        s.Process.User.Username = userstr
        return nil
    }

whose own comment says the name is "a temporary holding spot until the guest can
use the string to perform these same operations to grab the uid:gid inside".
Nothing in the guest ever did. This is that missing half.

The guest has the rootfs mounted already, so the lookup is an ordinary file read
needing no privilege the guest does not have. It runs in NewContainer, after the
rootfs components are mounted and before crun is handed the spec -- the only
point at which the image's /etc/passwd exists and the container does not.

Every USER form the image spec allows is accepted -- `user`, `uid`, `user:group`,
`uid:gid`, `uid:group`, `user:gid` -- following containerd's own reading of them
so that a spec resolved here and one resolved by oci.WithUser on a Linux host
agree. That includes two rules that are not obvious: a numeric uid absent from
/etc/passwd resolves to that uid with gid 0 rather than failing (oci.WithUserID),
and the primary gid is prepended to AdditionalGids only when it is not already
there (ensureAdditionalGids). Supplementary groups come from /etc/group as in
oci.WithAdditionalGIDs.

It fails open. A rootfs with no /etc/passwd, a name absent from the one that is
there, an unreadable config.json: each leaves the spec exactly as it arrived and
lets crun proceed, because this code only ever runs on a spec a host already gave
up on, so "leave it alone" is the behaviour that was already in place. What it
will not do is guess -- an unresolvable name is logged at WARN rather than
silently becoming uid 0, which is the failure the change exists to prevent.

No new dependency: the passwd/group parsing is ~60 lines here rather than a
vendored user library, so the patch stays reviewable and `go mod vendor` is
untouched.

Tests use testing/fstest and a temp-dir bundle, so they need no VM, no root and
no image. They were mutation-checked: making the resolver a no-op (the pre-patch
behaviour) fails TestResolveSpecUserRewritesTheBundle, removing the own-group
skip fails TestSupplementalGroupsSkipsTheUsersOwnGroup, and letting an
unresolvable name fall through to uid 0 fails both
TestResolveUserStringRefusesToGuess and
TestResolveSpecUserLeavesAnUnresolvableNameAlone.

NOT EXECUTED IN A VM. The mechanism is read from crun's and containerd's sources
and the tests run the resolver directly; no microVM has booted with this change.

Subject: [PATCH] fix(shim): raise the layer count at which layers are packed
 into one disk

An image with more than eight erofs layers stops getting one virtio-block
device per layer and is packed into a single GPT-partitioned VMDK instead.
On libkrun that path fails at mount time:

  mount source: "/dev/vdc4", target: "…/mounts/4", fstype: erofs,
  flags: 1, data: "", err: invalid argument

The message names neither layers nor a disk format, so nothing in it
suggests that an image with eight layers works and the same image with
nine does not.

The threshold is far below what the device budget requires. Letters vda
through vdz give 26 devices; the libkrun manager reserves exactly one
(ReservedDisks() returns 1, for the guest rootfs), so containers have 25.
A container spends one on its writable ext4 layer, leaving 24 for erofs
layers and any volumes. Eight leaves 16 slots unused while sending every
image past it down a path that does not work here.

Raising it to 20 keeps a margin for volumes and for the reserved disk
while letting ordinary images -- a .NET SDK image is commonly 10 to 15
layers -- take the flat one-device-per-layer path, which is the path every
working sandbox on this runtime already takes.

This does not fix the packed path. An image with more than 20 layers still
takes it and still fails; that is a separate defect, and this patch is
deliberately the smaller change of using the code path that works for the
images people actually have.

Subject: [PATCH] fix(shim): report idmap mount support from Info

containerd refuses to create any task whose spec carries a
Mount.UIDMappings/GIDMappings -- which is how Boks asks for a workspace's
bind mount to be idmapped, see internal/sandbox/hostuser.go -- unless the
runtime says first that it can honour one:

  core/runtime/v2/task_manager.go, validateRuntimeFeatures():
    // runc ignores silently features it doesn't know about, so for things
    // that this is problematic let's check if this runc version supports
    // them.
    if err := m.validateRuntimeFeatures(ctx, opts); err != nil {
        return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to validate OCI runtime features: %w", err)
    }

That check calls the shim's Info RPC and tries to unmarshal its Features
field into an *features.Features. manager.Info() here never sets that
field, so every task creation that asks for an idmapped mount -- not only
ones the runtime would actually refuse -- fails before a task is even
attempted, with an error that names neither idmapping nor this method:

  failed to create shim task: failed to validate OCI runtime features:
  unmarshal runtime features: type with url : not found

"type with url : not found" is typeurl trying to resolve an empty
TypeUrl, which is what a never-populated *anypb.Any looks like. This is
not a graceful "unsupported" signal reaching the check's own fallback
path (the one guarding non-runc-compatible runtimes that report nothing)
-- that path only runs once typeurl.UnmarshalAny has succeeded, and an
empty Any fails there first.

containerd-shim-runc-v2 answers this by running `runc features` and
reporting whatever comes back (cmd/containerd-shim-runc-v2/manager/
manager_linux.go). That is not available here: crun runs inside the
guest, which is not started yet at the point containerd asks Info --
there is nothing to exec `crun features` against. What this project
already knows, at the point this file is built, is which crun release it
pins (1.24, this Dockerfile) and that it supports idmapped mounts --
confirmed by reading src/libcrun/linux.c at that tag, which creates a
throwaway user namespace per mount rather than requiring one on the
container (see packaging/nerdbox/README.md in Boks for that reading). So
this states that fact rather than discovering it at runtime.

The commented-out TODO this sits beside ("Get features list from
run_vminitd") is a different, larger thing -- forwarding whatever a live
guest reports -- and is left alone. This only answers the one question
containerd is actually asking before it will accept an idmapped mount at
all.
