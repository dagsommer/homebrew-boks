  # This formula is pinned to a nerdbox tag on purpose, and the pin is a Boks decision rather
  # than a packaging convenience: v0.2.3 is the release containing cd2c23f, the commit
  # docs/verification.md records the VM boundary being verified against. Moving it means the
  # shim under Boks is no longer the shim the evidence was collected with, so bump it
  # deliberately and re-run the procedure in that document.

    # What nerdbox's own `task build:shim` does, minus the parts that need Docker. The
    # no_grpc tag is upstream's; the shim links no C and dlopens libkrun at runtime through
    # purego, so a plain cross-free `go build` is the whole compile.
    system "go", "build", *std_go_args(
      output: bin/"containerd-shim-nerdbox-v1",
      tags:   "no_grpc",

    # Kept for post_install, which runs after Homebrew has finished relocating the keg. The
    # build directory is gone by then.

  end

  # The signature is applied here, not in `install`, and the ordering is the whole reason.
  #
  # libkrun cannot use Hypervisor.framework unless the process carries the
  # `com.apple.security.hypervisor` entitlement. Without it a sandbox does not fail to
  # start — it starts and then dies inside libkrun with `krun_start_enter failed: -22`,
  # which names neither code signing nor the entitlement. `boks doctor` has a check for
  # exactly this (`runtime entitlement`) because the error names nothing.
  #
  # Homebrew re-signs Mach-O files whose load commands it has had to patch, in
  # `fix_dynamic_linkage`. On Intel it re-signs with
  # `--preserve-metadata=entitlements,requirements,flags,runtime`; on Apple silicon it uses
  # ruby-macho's `MachO.codesign!`, which writes a plain ad-hoc signature and carries no
  # entitlements across. A shim signed during `install` — or baked into a bottle — could
  # therefore arrive unsigned-in-the-way-that-matters on precisely the architecture this
  # formula is restricted to. `fix_dynamic_linkage` runs before `post_install`
  # (FormulaInstaller#finish), so signing here is applied last and survives, whether the keg
  # was built from source or poured from a bottle.

  # The honest part. This formula installs the shim; it cannot install the guest.
  #
  # nerdbox boots a Linux kernel and an EROFS root filesystem that it builds with
  # `docker buildx bake` — the kernel from a kernel.org tarball, the rootfs with mkfs.erofs
  # over a Go init and a downloaded crun. Homebrew builds have no Docker and no Linux
  # cross-toolchain, so neither can be produced here. `boks` fetches them from a Boks release
  # instead, which is why installing `boks` gives you a working stack and installing this
  # formula alone does not.
  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      This formula installed the shim and signed it with com.apple.security.hypervisor.
      It did NOT install the guest kernel or root filesystem, which nerdbox builds with
      Docker and publishes nowhere. Until those two files exist, a sandbox fails at boot
      with:

        nerdbox-kernel not found in PATH or LIBKRUN_PATH

      `boks doctor` reports this as `guest image`: fail.

      `brew install boks` installs them, from a Boks release. To place them by hand instead,
      put both in #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/lib — which is on the shim's own search path on Apple
      silicon — or in any directory on containerd's PATH or on LIBKRUN_PATH:

        https://github.com/dagsommer/boks/releases

      containerd resolves this shim through its own PATH, which is the daemon's and not
      your shell's. If containerd cannot find #{opt_bin}, start it with that directory on
      PATH — or let `boks daemon start` do it.
