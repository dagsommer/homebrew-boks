  # macOS on Apple silicon is the only platform where Boks has been shown to work, and the
  # only one where the stack below can be installed at all: libkrun's formula is arm64 and
  # Hypervisor.framework only. Linux and Windows users are served by the release archives —
  # see docs/install.md — which is why this formula declines rather than pretending.
  # (`depends_on :macos` is the other half of this and sits below, where Homebrew's own
  # ordering rules put it.)
  depends_on arch: :arm64

  # The whole stack, not just the CLI. `boks doctor` checks all of these, and a formula that
  # installed one of five and left the user to discover the other four from failing checks
  # would not be much of an install.
  #
  # The containerd floor is 2.3, not 2.2. A shim linking containerd 2.3.3 emits version-3
  # bootstrap parameters a 2.2 daemon cannot decode; it reads the whole protobuf reply as an
  # address and dies with `unsupported protocol: Yunix`, naming neither a version nor a shim.
  # Homebrew cannot express a minimum version on a dependency, so this relies on
  # homebrew-core staying at 2.3+ and on `boks doctor`'s `runtime skew` line to catch a
  # machine that is behind anyway.
  #
  # nerdbox is the VM shim, from this same tap because it is packaged nowhere else. It pulls
  # in libkrun from the libkrun/krun tap in turn, and that tap has to be trusted as a whole —
  # see the tap README.
  depends_on "containerd"
  depends_on "dagsommer/boks/nerdbox"
  # This dependency is late because the gap was invisible: every macOS run recorded in
  # docs/verification.md happened on a machine that already had e2fsprogs 1.47.4 installed
  # (docs/verification.md:39), so the requirement never announced itself. A Mac without it
  # gets a green `boks doctor`, a clean `boks daemon start`, and a failure at the first
  # `boks run` reading `failed format ".../rwlayer.img": mkfs.ext4 ...`.
  #
  # e2fsprogs is KEG-ONLY in homebrew-core — it would shadow macOS' own /sbin/mke2fs and
  # friends — so this puts mkfs.ext4 in $(brew --prefix e2fsprogs)/sbin and links it onto no
  # PATH at all. Installing it is nevertheless enough, because internal/daemon/locate.go
  # appends that directory to the PATH it starts containerd with; see kegPrefixes there. Do
  # not "fix" this with a `link_overwrite` or by putting sbin on the user's PATH.
  depends_on "e2fsprogs"
  depends_on "erofs-utils"

  # e2fsprogs, for mkfs.ext4, and it is not optional on macOS.
  #
  # Off Linux the erofs snapshotter runs in block mode: containerd's defaultWritableSize is
  # 64 MiB in erofs_other.go and 0 in erofs_linux.go, and `blockMode = defaultSize > 0`
  # (erofs.go:187). So every active snapshot gets its own ext4 image at
  # <erofs root>/snapshots/<id>/rwlayer.img, and containerd's mount manager formats it by
  # running mkfs.ext4 at task start. No configuration turns that off.
  #

  depends_on :macos

  # The guest kernel and EROFS root filesystem the microVM boots.
  #
  # nerdbox builds these with `docker buildx bake` and publishes neither, so `nerdbox.rb`
  # cannot produce them: a Homebrew build has no Docker and no Linux cross-toolchain. A Boks
  # release does publish them, so they are fetched rather than built. Without them a sandbox
  # dies at boot with `nerdbox-kernel not found in PATH or LIBKRUN_PATH` and `boks doctor`
  # reports `guest image  fail`.
  #
  # The kernel is GPL-2.0 and nerdbox patches it. The archive carries a SOURCE.txt naming the
  # cdn.kernel.org tarball, the config and the patch set it was built from, which is how the
  # corresponding-source obligation is met.

  def caveats
    <<~EOS
      Run `boks doctor` now. It checks every prerequisite and prints what to do about each
      gap. Nothing needs root: `boks daemon start` starts containerd itself, rootless, and
      writes its configuration by hand.

      containerd resolves the nerdbox shim through the daemon's PATH, not your shell's. A
      containerd `boks daemon start` launched inherits your shell's PATH, which already has
      #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/bin on it; one launched from launchd or `brew services` probably
      does not, and will report the shim as missing.

      The guest kernel and root filesystem are installed, in #{HOMEBREW_PREFIX}/lib.
      `boks doctor` reports them as `guest image`.
